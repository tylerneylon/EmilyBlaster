# EmilyBlaster

*A silly tiny game inspired by the book Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow*

## Credits

* Gabrielle Zevin wrote a book called Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow,
  which I like. This game is from that book.
* Sadie Miranda Green wrote EmilyBlaster for a class she was taking in college.
  However, Sadie is a fictional character in the aforementioned novel. But I
  thought I'd give her some credit anyway.
* Many of the images in this game were generated with the Flux Pro 1.1 model,
  and then I edited them. Thanks, Flux.
* I used a font called [Dogica](https://www.dafont.com/dogica.font)
  by Roberto Mocci, who made the font available for
  anyone to use. Sadie might say that Roberto's a real mensch (which is good, if
  there's any doubt).
